# Volcanic Mine
Volcanic Mine script for RuneMate

Solves the Volcanic Mine using the 408 points solo method.

This is all in Kotlin.

Every interaction here is done using DirectInput, this isn't the best practice for interactions that dont "require" precision.
Volcanic Mine is deadly so I decided to go with it.

I added a few comments to help understand my logic, most of them are in the VolcanicMine.kt class
